# Narrative Visualization

## 1. Prospectus

This project concerns the context of low fertility rate in South Korea, especially from the perspective of women's work-life balance. Various reports and articles that are trying to explain the most contributing cause of this issue have been published. However, the debate is still ongoing since too many relevant factors are intertwined. I would like to present the social term "Women in Employment Discontinuity" and how it is for the current fertility rate togehter in order to see more broader contextual narrative. The project will begin from the idea that the expectation of the younger generation on the qualitiy of life is low, and why it is happening. I assume that the audiences are not the experts on this issue, but they might have heard about some countries wiht extremely low fertility rate. I am planning to use multiple data sets provided by the administration of statistics in South Korea including population of women in employment discontinuity and employment rate. The overall layout of the project is yet to be designed.

## 2. Brainstorming

- Topic: Low fertility rate in South Korea from the perspective of women's work-life balance

- Research question: 1) What is the problem? 2) What is Women in Employment Disconinuity? 3) How 2 is related to employment insecurity/inequality? 4) How do social norms take place here?

- Signiciance: This may give the audience an opportunity to think about women in their society
