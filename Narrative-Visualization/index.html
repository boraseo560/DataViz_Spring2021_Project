                Introduction  </h3>
      <p> The slowing fertility rate is a global trend. However, it appears to be more extreme in some countries. This has been one of the major social issues in South Korea. As many experts and published work analyzed, the possible causes of this problem cannot be simplified since a lot of different factors are intertwined in a larger context. This project will focus on a slice of the context that concerns relationship between the declining fertility rate and women’s work-life balance in South Korea.    </p>

      <div class="exp">
            <p class="p-first"> In the past, the wage gap was simply explained by multiple reasons: women had less opportunity to get enough qualification to enter job market, or there are less women in the field with the higher salary. These are still valid and important reasons, but the wage gap occurs even between men and women in the same job with the same qualification. The experts say that the large portion of the current wage gap is an inexplicable problem, and a fundamental inequality that should be solved.  
            Wage gap is also related to the insecurity of employment, so it often forces women to choose one between work and personal life. By the result, women experience Employment Discontinuity with a lower or zero salary. </p>

      <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion  </h3>
      <p class="p-first"> The government of South Korea has been investing a lot of effort to solve the low fertility rate. However, there are critical opinions that the government is overlooking more fundamental issues, and one of them is a systemic cycle that hinders women's work-life balance. If having a child means puting one's career life a risk, then it is undertandable for not taking that risk.   </p>
      <p class="p-second">In order to fix a problem, there should be active conversation about it. I hope this project would provide a material that could motivate the conversation. </p>
